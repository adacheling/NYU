# Predicting Causes of Vehicle collision
Vehicle collisions have been on an increasing trend in the last decade. Nearly 1.3 million people die in vehicle collisions each year, on average 3,287 deaths a day with an additional 20-50 million are injured or disabled. Currently, road crashes are ranked as the ninth most serious cause of death in the world, and without new initiatives to improve road safety, fatal crashes will likely rise to the third place by the year 2020.
In this term project, we will focus on vehicle collisions in New York city and predict the most likely contributing factor of a collision if it happened using features extracted from historical records of vehicle collisions in 2016 and 2017.
